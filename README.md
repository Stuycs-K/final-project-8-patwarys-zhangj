## Overview
For our final project, we created the game Minesweeper. Minesweeper is a logic puzzle game. Its main objective is to uncover a grid-based field while avoiding the mines, which are randomly placed within the grid. In order to help the players, numbers are placed in the uncovered portion to indicate the number of mines in the surrounding squares(zeros will not be shown). Once the player reveals all the squares that donâ€™t contain any mines without exploding any mine, they win the game. Also, we added one additional feature, which isn't a part of the original game: if you click on a bomb, the game will end like normal, but you have the option to go back and continue. However, it will reset your score.
